## Working with the UCI Bike Sharing Dataset

The purpose of this repository is myself practice of neural networks. I am a student that is learning, let me know if you find any errors, **the original code is from examples and exercises found in books, tutorials and other sources all mentioned in this file.** I am just practicing what I have learned, the proper authors and creators of the algorithms/code are the ones mentioned in the file.

I will be using Streamlit to develop an App where I will be sharing what I've learned. To run the app install the requirements and run the app with streamlit:


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parismollo/LogisticRegression/master/logistic_regression.py
```
